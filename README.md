# Introduction
This project looked at movie data from the Bryan vs Bryan podcast.  As a fan of the show, I decided to collect and analyze the data for movies being reviewed.

 - Note: Not all of the podcast episodes are for movies.  This dataset is for the movie episodes only.


# Background
The motivation behind this project was that I wanted to understand and visualize the movie data.  I also wanted to understand the scores for each of the hosts.  I was curious as to how they would compare or differ across various variables.

The questions that I was really interested in were:

1. Which movies the highest rated (cumulative score)?
2. Which host consistently rates movies higher than the other?
3. How does genre, budget, MPA rating, and length impact the score?
4. Which movies do the two hosts agree (same score)?
5. Which movies do the two hosts disagree the most?
