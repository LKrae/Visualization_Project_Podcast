# Introduction
This project looked to visualize movie data from the Bryan vs Bryan podcast.  I wanted to understand how each host scored movies. I decided to collect and analyze their scores along with the metadata for the movies being reviewed.

Thank you to Bryan B. for giving me permission to publish this work.

>[!NOTE]
Not all of the podcast episodes are for movies.  This dataset is for the movie episodes only.

 # Data Updates
 I'll try to update the dataset when a new episode is released.


# Background
The motivation behind this project was that I wanted to understand and visualize the movie score data for each host. I was also curious as to how they would compare or differ across various variables (e.g., budget, movie length, etc.)

The questions that I was really interested in were:

1. Which movies are the highest/lowest rated (cumulative score)?
2. How do each host's scores compare/differ?
    - Does one host tend to rate things higher?
3. How does genre, budget, MPA rating, and length impact the score?
4. Which movies do the two hosts agree/disagree the most?
5. Which movies spent the most/least per score point?


# Analysis
Bryan Vs Bryan has reviewed 201 movies (as of 11/19/2024).

- Bryan B's average score: 7.11
- Bryan W's average score: 7.02
- The total scores given for all movies: 2,797.35
- The average score for all movies:      14.13
- The median score for all movies:       14.00
- The maximum score for all movies:      20.00 for Django Unchained and The Blair Witch Project
- The minimum score for all movies:      6.70 for Tom and Jerry

The action genre is the most popular, followed by horror and comedy.

## Which movies are the highest/lowest rated (cumulative score)?
I was really curious to see how the host's views of movies align with my own.  Which movies did they love and which did they really dislike?  

### Top 10 Movies (Highest Cumulative Score)

## Which movies spent the most/least per score point?
I was really interested in how much movies spend per point.  Spending less per point means that a movie is utilizing its budget efficiently.  Ideally, a movie has a low budget and a high score.  The worst case scenarios is spending a lot of money and receiving a low score.  The following tables provide insight into the movies that spent the most and the least per point.

# Conclusion
This was a really fun and interesting project to tackle.  I enjoyed collecting the data, creating the visuals, and analyzing the outputs.  My goal was to understand how the hosts differ, how their scores align with my own "score" of the movie, and how various movie variables (e.g., budget) impacted the scores.
