# Introduction
This project looked at movie score data from the Bryan vs Bryan podcast.  I decided to collect and analyze the data for movies being reviewed.

 [!NOTE] Not all of the podcast episodes are for movies.  This dataset is for the movie episodes only.

 # Data Update
 I'll try to update the dataset when a new episode is released.


# Background
The motivation behind this project was that I wanted to understand and visualize the movie score data for each host. I was also curious as to how they would compare or differ across various variables (e.g., budget or length)

The questions that I was really interested in were:

1. Which movies are the highest/lowest rated (cumulative score)?
2. Which host consistently rates movies higher than the other?
3. How do each host's scores differ?
4. How does genre, budget, MPA rating, and length impact the score?
5. Which movies do the two hosts agree/disagree the most?
6. Which movies spent the most/least per score point?

# Analysis
Bryan Vs Bryan has reviewed 184 movies (as of 7/7/2024).

- Bryan B's average score: 7.15
- Bryan W's average score: 7.05
- The total scores given for all movies: 2,569.85
- The average cumulative score for all movies: 14.20
- The median cumulative score for all movies: 14.20
- The maximum cumulative score for all movies: 20.00 for Django Unchained and The Blair Witch Project
- The minimum cumulative score for all movies: 6.70 for Tom and Jerry

The action genre is the most popular, followed by horror and comedy.

## Which movies spent the most/least per score point?
I was really interested in how much movies spend per point.  Spending less per point means that a movie is utilizing its budget efficiently.  Ideally, a movie has a low budget and a high score.  Worst case scenarios is spending a lot of money and receiving a low score.  The following tables provide insight into the moves that spent the most and the least per point.
